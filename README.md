Are you the type of modded Minecraft player that makes a beeline for the designated endgame and then gives up on ever playing again once you get there? Do you wish there was a way to make the process take significantly longer? Do you love GregTech, but wish it weren't so short? Do you sit down on your chest full of iridium plates and wish there was a mod that didn't just hand things to you on a silver platter? This might be the mod for you!
